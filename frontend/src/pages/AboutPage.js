                        <span>H</span>ey! Aaron, Erick, Sanjay, and Kent here. We're students at Columbia looking to change
                        the way that people interact with music. As musicians ourselves, we are interested in
                        how music contributes to our own wellness and so we figured: why not use tech to help others achieve 
                        this? That was the motivation behind Polyphony, Greek for "many sounds" (i.e. many sounds for many feelings.),
                        a web app that help get in touch with your feelings through music. We've put a lot of work into this project
                        and we're excited to share what we've come up with you. We hope you enjoy Polyphony!
